# Super-Science-Conference-Database

I played a key role in developing a scalable SQL database using T-SQL to manage data for the Super Science Conference. This database efficiently stores and organizes information for 500+ attendees, 50+ presentations, and potentially other conference aspects.

Technical Skills Demonstrated:

    T-SQL Proficiency: Utilized various T-SQL features such as foreign keys to establish robust relationships between data tables, ensuring data integrity and efficient retrieval.
    Data Modeling: Contributed to designing the database schema, ensuring optimal data organization for conference management needs.

Additional Features :

    User Management: Implemented a secure user management system to control access to different data sections.
    Search Functionality: Integrated search capabilities for efficient retrieval of conference information by attendees, organizers, or speakers.
    Data Analytics Integration: Prepared the database structure to facilitate future integration with data analytics tools for post-conference insights.
